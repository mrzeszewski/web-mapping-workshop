## Publishing map draft

After you have created some interesting map you need a way to show it to someone.
The best way is to create a simple (or more complicated) website with embedded map. And we will do it in a monment. 
But there is an even easier way that you can use right now. Follow this steps:

1. In the upper right corner of the **Style Editor** click **Publish**
2. You will see an interactive window which show the changes from the last publish.
3. You can click publish or publish a copy. The latter option is a good way to create a couple different styles when you cannot decide which one is the best...
4. When map is published you can click **Share** and among the various options you will see *Share URL**. You can copy this and share with anyone you like
5. Kudos for you! You have your own web map! 

This sharing option is somewhat limited but in the next step we will do something about it and you will get a proper website.
