#3 Crash course in web mapping - a simple map using Mapbox Studio
Although most tutorials will have you start with some data we will go for a different route. Let's hope this  will save us some mileage in the learning process.

 1. Open [Mapbox Studio](http://studio.mapbox.com)
 2. Click on the **Styles** section in the upper right corner
 3. Select **New style** and choose **Basic template**. Don't worry you'll have the opportunity to explore other map styles as well!
 4. Click **Customize basic template** What you see is the **Style Editor**. Take a moment and look around. This not an ordinary image. Right click on the map and hold. Move the mouse up and down or right and left to see something cool! 
 5. Map that is being displayed is being created in the browser by combining **layers** you see on the left. You can left-click anywhere on the map and you will see a list of individual layers that are being overlayed in this particular spot.
 6. Those layers are different in types but they are all **vector** layers. What that means is that they can be can be changed anyway you like.
 7. Select one spot - preferably with large green or water area and click on it to see what layers can be changed there. Select one layer a new window will expand on the left. For a start - choose a different color.
 8. Changes are saved automatically.
 9. Experiment with various options. See how layers look different on various zoom levels. **When you are designing a web map you are designing many maps at the same time! **
