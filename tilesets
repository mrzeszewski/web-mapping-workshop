Tilests are the building blocks of Mapbox maps. They consist of vector data that is generalized into regular square grid at 22 zoom levels. Maps are build by associating style to tilesets - there are analogs of map layers in Desktop GIS. 
Tilesets can be accessed outside Mapbox Studio environment through Mapbox GL JS library and other mobile libraries. 

To create a tileset you have two options - either you create it for previously uploaded dataset or you can convert uploaded data. Mapbox accept various formats but there are some caveats. If something is not working try converting the data outside the Mapbox.

Try to upload some data:

 1. Download three sample layers:
 2. You can start uploading new file even when the previous one is still being processed.
 3. After processing is finished you will have three new shiny Tilesets that you can add to your map.

In the next step we will add them to the map.
