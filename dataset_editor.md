## Dataset Editor

Apart from using data created elsewhere (in GIS software or in spreadsheet) you can create simple data in Mapbox web GUI.
This tool is called [Dataset Editor](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/datasets/). 

1. When in [Mapbox Studio](https://studio.mapbox.com/) click on the **Dataset** tab.
2. Datasets are stored in the [GeoJSON format](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-geojson). 
3. There you can **Create Dataset** by uploading data (in GeoJSON, JSON or CSV) or (and this is a default behavior) you can create a Blank Dataset and add some data using GUI. 
4. When you choose to create a Blank Dataset you can add points, lines and polygons as well as create properties to assign to them.
5. Be aware that although you can include together points, lines and polygons in a single datasest it is currently better to keep  them separated (I've encountered some strange behavior while doing this).
6. When you are finished you can **Save** the datasest and then export it to a **Tileset** - which in turn can be used on the map.

### Let's create a map together!

Let's have some more mapping fun. Try to add 3-5 points around the Campus. Select **places that are important to you**, that you want to share with others - maybe you even have some kind of story to share.  

Add two properties for each point:
1. **NAME** - just name the place anyway you like
2. **DESCRIPTION** - describe why this place is important, tell others what is so special about it, tell a story.

After you have added all the points you wanted, **Save** the dataset and from the **Datasets** tab of the Mapbox Studio download the resulting file (it will be in the .geojson format). Then, send it to me: [mrzeszewski@gmail.com](mailto:mrzeszewski@gmail.com).
During my stay I will create **a web map for your campus** and I will send it to you.
