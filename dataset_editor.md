This tool is called [Dataset Editor](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/datasets/). 

1. When in [Mapbox Studio]{https://studio.mapbox.com/) click on the **Dataset** tab.
2. There you can **Create Dataset** by uploading data
3. Datasets are stored in the [GeoJSON format](https://www.mapbox.com/help/define-geojson).
