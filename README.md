# Workshop materials
## I. Introduction

In this course You will learn how to design, compose, construct and publish an online map. We will be doing all this using Mapbox platform and we will start with the introduction to its web interface. In the next stages we will use Javascript library to extend our map with more advanced user interactions.

Let's start with materials about Mapbox and examples of its use.

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mrzeszewski/web-mapping-workshop/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
