## Using tilesets to create map layers
To use tilesets in your map go to the [Styles Editor](https://studio.mapbox.com/styles/) and for each new tileset follow the procedure below:

 1. Select **+** sign in the upper left corner and in the new window scroll down until you see the names of the tilesets you've just added. _Be patient - it takes some time for the list to load_
 2. Click on the tileset name and after it expand click on the type of the geometry below.
 3. On the left you can choose which layer type you want to use to display the tileset. It is possible for example to display polygons as lines, fills, symbols or heatmaps. 
 4. You can also filter the data or limit the visibility to a certain range of zoom levels.
 5. When you are done you can select **Style** to begin styling the layer
 6. At any moment you can click on **Select source** to switch to a different layer type. However, any changes in style will be removed.
